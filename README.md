## 1. Global Health Spending Landscape

Health investment is a key driver of health outcomes worldwide. This section highlights global health expenditure patterns, temporal trends, and disparities across income groups.  

- 🌍 **Global Health Expenditure % of GDP (Year 2022)**

*Figure 1.3: Variability within income groups is evident; some upper-middle-income countries outperform peers, while low-income countries show limited investment in health services.*

**Key Insights**  
1. Investment Gap: High-income countries consistently spend more, both per capita and as % of GDP.  
2. Financial Burden: Out-of-pocket expenses remain a major barrier in low- and lower-middle-income countries.  
3. Temporal Trends: Spending has increased across all income groups over 2010–2022, but disparities persist.

> "While global health expenditure has grown over the last decade, stark disparities remain. High-income countries consistently invest more in health systems, whereas low-income regions face persistent financial constraints, leaving populations vulnerable. Having explored these expenditure patterns and the financial burden on individuals, a natural question arises: how do these patterns relate to population structure? As countries move towards aging societies, they face increasing demands for healthcare services and greater per-capita spending. Examining the relationship between aging populations and health investment helps highlight potential challenges and opportunities for sustainable health policy.”

## 4. Global Disease Burden Trends (GBD)

Understanding global disease burden patterns helps contextualize health spending priorities. This section examines DALYs trends across four major categories, highlighting temporal changes and regional disparities.

- 📊 **% of DALYs by Disease Category in each Income Group (Year 2010–2021)**  

![Figure 4.1](https://github.com/polyst08/pandasproject-healthexpenditure/blob/main/Figure-Section01-04-05/Figure4.1.png)  

*Figure 1: Stacked area chart showing the proportion of DALYs for CMNN, Injuries, NCDs, and COVID-related outcomes from 2010–2021, overlaid with trend lines to highlight temporal changes. CMNN burden decreases in high-income countries but remains high in LMICs; NCDs show a steady increase globally; Injuries remain relatively stable; COVID-related outcomes show a clear spike in 2020–2021.*

- 🌍 **DALYs per 100,000 Population by Disease Category (Year 2021)**  

![Figure 2](https://github.com/polyst08/pandasproject-healthexpenditure/blob/main/Figure-Section01-04-05/Figure4.2.png) 

*Figure 4.2: Regional disparities highlight how different categories dominate in various contexts. Africa shows high CMNN burden, high-income regions are dominated by NCDs, and injuries/COVID impact varies across regions.*

**Key Insights**  
1. Epidemiological Transition: High-income countries increasingly face NCDs, while LMICs continue to struggle with CMNN diseases.  
2. Injury Trends: DALYs from injuries remain stable or slightly declining, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures and safety systems.  
3. Shock Events: COVID-19 illustrates how sudden events can dramatically alter disease burden composition.  
4. Policy Implications: Disease burden composition shapes resource allocation and health policy priorities, ensuring interventions match regional needs and demographic profiles.

> “Global disease burden trends reveal a dual challenge: low- and middle-income countries must continue addressing communicable and maternal-child health issues, while high-income societies face a rising burden of chronic diseases. Injuries remain an important concern, and COVID-19 highlights the impact of unexpected shocks. The stacked area with trend lines allows us to see both the composition and temporal patterns of DALYs, providing a clear picture of how disease priorities vary across regions and over time. Understanding these patterns is essential for guiding strategic health investment and preparing resilient health systems tailored to each region’s needs.”

## 5. Linking Disease Burden to Spending

After examining global disease burden and regional disparities, the next step is to see how countries respond through health spending. This section explores total health expenditure globally, trends over time by income group, and pharmaceutical spending in OECD countries, linking disease burden to financial investment.

- 📉 **Global Regression: DALYs vs Health Expenditure per Capita (Year 2010–2021)**  

![Figure 5.1](https://github.com/polyst08/pandasproject-healthexpenditure/blob/main/Figure-Section01-04-05/Figure5.1.png) 

*Figure 1: Scatter plot with regression lines showing the relationship between DALYs and health expenditure per capita across countries. Low-income countries experience high disease burden with limited spending, whereas high-income countries show lower DALYs with higher expenditure. Separate trend lines illustrate differences in responsiveness across income groups.*

- 📈 **DALYs & Health Expenditure Trend per Income Group (Year 2010–2021)**  

![Figure 5.2](https://github.com/polyst08/pandasproject-healthexpenditure/blob/main/Figure-Section01-04-05/Figure5.2.png)  

*Figure 2: Trends of DALYs (left) and health expenditure per capita (right) from 2010–2021, shown as separate graphs by income group. The visualization highlights how disease burden and spending evolve differently over time across income levels, reflecting differences in effectiveness and resource allocation.*

- 📊 **OECD: NCD DALYs vs Pharmaceutical Expenditure with Aging Impact (Year 2010–2021)**  

![Figure 5.3](https://github.com/polyst08/pandasproject-healthexpenditure/blob/main/Figure-Section01-04-05/Figure5.3.png)  

*Figure 3: Bubble chart + line overlay for OECD countries. Bubble size and color represent %65+ population. Pharmaceutical expenditure rises with aging, while NCD DALYs trend over time, illustrating the “double pressure” of aging populations and rising drug costs.*

**Key Insights**  
1. Global Inequities: Low-income countries face high DALYs but limited health expenditure, highlighting gaps in access and resource allocation.  
2. Income Group Differences: Trend lines show that disease burden and spending evolve differently over time; higher-income countries tend to reduce burden with increased spending, while lower-income countries remain constrained.  
3. OECD Focus: Aging populations strongly influence pharmaceutical spending, which can dominate total health expenditure.  
4. Outliers: Certain OECD countries spend disproportionately on pharmaceuticals relative to NCD DALYs, signaling potential inefficiencies or policy challenges.  
5. Policy Implications: Aligning spending with disease burden and demographic pressures is essential. OECD countries must balance aging-related NCD care with sustainable pharmaceutical investment, while low- and middle-income countries should prioritize investment where disease burden is high.
 
>“Linking disease burden to health expenditure by income group uncovers stark contrasts. Low-income countries bear high disease burden with limited resources, whereas high-income countries reduce burden through higher spending. Trends over time demonstrate that income level affects both the magnitude and efficiency of spending. In OECD nations, aging populations and rising pharmaceutical costs create a “double pressure,” reinforcing the need for targeted, efficient, and sustainable health investment strategies. This section bridges the lens of health outcomes (DALYs) to financial inputs, guiding both global and country-specific policy decisions.”

## 6. Conclusion & Policy Implications

**Key Takeaways**  
- High-income countries invest more in health and reduce disease burden more effectively than low-income countries.  
- Aging populations drive both health expenditure and pharmaceutical spending, particularly in OECD nations.  
- Disease burden composition (CMNN, NCDs, Injuries, COVID) shapes health policy priorities and resource allocation.  
- Strategic investment must align with demographic trends and disease burden to ensure sustainable health outcomes.  

**Policy Implications**  
- Low- and middle-income countries: Target investment to reduce high disease burden efficiently.  
- OECD/high-income countries: Manage aging-related pressures and rising pharmaceutical costs with sustainable policies (e.g., drug pricing, reimbursement strategies).  
- Global perspective: Allocate resources based on disease burden composition and demographic context to maximize impact and efficiency.
